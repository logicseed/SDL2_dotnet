# SDL2_dotnet

The initial plan is to perform a straight interop wrapping of the SDL2 libraries. Then a full-fledged
C#-style library will be constructed to ease the use of the unmanaged SDL2 libraries. Additionally
examples will be constructed that mimic the tutorials created by Lazy Foo, and unit testing will be
performed everywhere it is feasible.
